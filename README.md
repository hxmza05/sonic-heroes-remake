# Sonic Heroes Recreated 🎮

> 🎮 A C++/SFML Sonic Heroes-style platformer with character switching, AI companions, and a hidden "OOP" cheat code to unlock Mario.

A **2D remake of SEGA's *Sonic Heroes*** — created as our **2nd semester Object-Oriented Programming project** using **C++ and SFML**.

This project brings the classic team-based gameplay of *Sonic Heroes* to life with unique character abilities, AI followers, enemy mechanics, a boss level, and even a cheat code crossover — all built from scratch in C++.
